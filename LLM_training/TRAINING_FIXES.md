# Mistral LoRA Training - Fixes Applied

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Broken Loss Computation (CRITICAL)**
**Problem**: The original code used:
```python
loss = mx.mean(-mx.log(mx.softmax(shift_logits, axis=-1) + 1e-8))
```
This was inefficient and not computing actual cross-entropy properly.

**Fix**: Replaced with proper log_softmax:
```python
log_probs = mx.log_softmax(shift_logits, axis=-1)
loss = -mx.mean(log_probs)
```

### 2. **Gradient Accumulation Issues**
**Problem**: The gradient accumulation logic attempted to accumulate gradients but never properly applied them due to condition checking issues.

**Fix**: Simplified gradient flow:
- Apply gradients immediately after computing them
- Process one example at a time with proper error handling
- Removed complex gradient accumulation that wasn't working

### 3. **Loss Always Zero (Data Corruption)**
**Problem**: All checkpoints showed loss = 0, indicating:
- Loss wasn't being computed correctly
- NaN values were being silently converted to 0
- No actual training was happening

**Fix**: Added NaN checking:
```python
if not (loss_float != loss_float):  # Check for NaN
    # Process valid loss
```

### 4. **Model Forward Pass Issues**
**Problem**: Calling `model(input_ids)` directly without proper batching

**Fix**: Reshape input properly:
```python
logits = model(input_ids.reshape(1, -1))  # Add batch dimension
```

### 5. **Tokenizer Compatibility**
**Problem**: Using `return_tensors="np"` might not be supported by MLX tokenizer

**Fix**: No change needed - keep working with numpy arrays internally

## Changes Made

### Cell 21 - Training Functions
- **train_epoch()**:
  - Fixed loss computation with proper log_softmax
  - Added NaN checking for loss values
  - Simplified gradient handling
  - Proper error handling at each step
  - Memory cleanup every 10 steps (unchanged)

- **validate_model()**:
  - Fixed validation loss computation
  - Proper shape handling for logits
  - Added NaN checking

### Training State Reset
- Reset training state to epoch 0, step 0
- Cleared best_loss and checkpoints
- Fresh start for next training run

## How to Run

1. **In Jupyter**: Run the notebook as-is
2. **Monitor**: Loss should now be > 0 and decreasing
3. **Expected**:
   - Loss starts around 5-10 (varies with data)
   - Decreases gradually over steps
   - Checkpoints save every 200 steps
   - Training completes 3 epochs

## Performance Notes

- **Batch size**: 1 (minimum for memory efficiency)
- **Max sequence length**: 256 tokens (reduced from 512)
- **Gradient accumulation**: Simplified (gradients applied immediately)
- **Memory target**: 8-10GB RAM usage
- **Estimated time**: ~2-3 hours for 3 epochs on M1 Mac

## If Training Still Crashes

Common issues:

1. **Out of Memory**: Reduce `max_seq_length` to 128
2. **Slow/Hanging**: Check if GPU is overheating (reduce batch processing frequency)
3. **NaN losses**: Data might have special characters - validate training data
4. **Model not loading**: Ensure `mlx-lm` is installed: `pip install mlx mlx-lm`

## Next Steps

After successful training:
1. Check loss convergence in logs
2. Test model generation (cell 24)
3. Save final model (cell 26)
4. Create inference script (cell 28)
5. Integrate with Express API
